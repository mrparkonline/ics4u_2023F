# The Most Number of Factors (Solution Link)
# From 1 to N, where N is an integer greater one. We will output the number between [1,N] that has the most factors. 
# Example: From numbers 1 to 5. â†’ The number 4 has the most factors.

# Solution Planning
#   1. Take N is input
#   2. Set max_count to 0, set the result_num to 0 ... variable initialization
#   3. Generate numbers from [1 to N]
#   4. count the number of factors if each numbers generated
#   5. if the new count is larger than our max_count, update max_count and result_num
