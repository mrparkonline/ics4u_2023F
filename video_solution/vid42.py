'''Highest Scrabble Word

Given a list of strings, determine the string with the highest scrabble score.

The Scrabble Point System:
1 point: E,A,I,O,N,R,T,L,S,U
2 points: D,G
3 points: B,C,M,P
4 points: F,H,V,W,Y
5 points: K
8 points: J,X
10 points: Q,Z

The characters of the word will be totaled up for a score. Example: CAT has a score of 5 (3+1+1).

Write a function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a list with two items â†’ [highest_scoring_word, highest_score]
