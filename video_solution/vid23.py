# Q7) Average Calculator (Solution Link)
# Create a program that calculates the averages of the marks that user inputs. 
# The user is allowed to input any amount of marks they want as long as it is 0 to 100.

# Solution Plan

# 1. Create an infinite loop with a variable set to True
# 2. Set the variable false when user input is "exit"
# 3. add valid marks to a variable, count the number of valid marks
# 4. After exiting the loop when possible, then calculate the average
